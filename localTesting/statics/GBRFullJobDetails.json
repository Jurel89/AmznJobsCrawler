Studies show that veterans leave their first post-transition jobs at higher rates than their civilian counterparts. As such, searching for that post-transition role is as much about finding a company where you can picture yourself being successful as it is about finding the right role; we hope it will be with us, via the Amazon Corporate Military Program (ACMP).<br/> <br/>The ACMP is an opportunity for service leavers, looking for their first role after leaving Armed Forces, to begin a commercial career in eCommerce. We are looking for high performing, customer obsessed individuals to help us solve real business problems within our corporate e-commerce business, via a salaried program.<br/> <br/>On joining the program, you will undertake a short period of training with your ACMP cohort to familiarise yourself with Amazon\u2019s peculiar ways, and to train you in analytical techniques and tools. You will then join your team, and be presented with a specific problem or opportunity to solve. You will be expected to dive deep into the problem, think big to develop a solution, gain buy-in from senior stakeholders, and then execute your plan in order to deliver results to delight our customers. During this time, you will be supported by fellow veterans within Amazon Stores and the Warriors@Amazon affinity group, and be given the opportunity to network in order to find permanent roles within the business.<br/> <br/>What is Amazon Stores?<br/>We like to think of ourselves as Amazon Classic. We are the people behind Amazons eCommerce business. We manage selling partner and customer experience for what people know as Amazon.co.uk (http://amazon.co.uk/). Customers experience our work when they are able to find what they are looking for at a great price on Amazon.co.uk. We push the eCommerce industry forward by focusing on delivering innovation in mobile, social and community shopping.<br/><br/>What sort of projects are available on the Program?<br/>Projects will be aligned to our core Corporate roles including, but not limited to: Vendor Manager, Instock Manager, Product Manager, Program Manager, Account Manager. Successful candidates will be matched to specific projects across the Stores business based on a combination of: candidate career interests, military work experience, education and any applicable industry experience. <br/><br/>What will I join as?<br/>All hires will enter Amazon as an individual contributor (IC), as part of an ACMP cohort. Individual contributors own and drive the growth of their business, accounts, categories, programs and/or technical products. Entering Amazon as an IC is normal, even for candidates with people management and 10+ years of direct industry experience. <br/><br/>When will the program start?<br/>We plan to have 2 in-takes in 2023 - Spring and Autumn. Exact dates TBC.<br/><br/>Where are the jobs located?<br/>The projects will be located at Amazon\u2019s UK HQ in London and our office in Manchester.<br/> <br/> **Please note: This is a 6 month paid placement on a fixed-term contract basis. Successful candidates will have the opportunity to apply for any available permanent roles during their contract (but Amazon cannot guarantee the availability of any particular permanent roles and/or that candidates will be offered permanent roles).**<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

Based in the beautiful cities of Edinburgh, Seattle and Boulder, our teams are developing innovations to support advertisers at massive scale. We are responsible for defining and delivering ad targeting products to help advertisers plan media, gain insights about customer behaviours, create audience strategies, and more. <br/><br/>Our products are at the heart of our display advertising business. We ensure that billions of ads served are relevant to our customers. We are highly motivated, collaborative and fun-loving with an entrepreneurial spirit and bias for action. With a broad mandate to experiment and innovate, we are growing at an unprecedented rate with a seemingly endless range of new opportunities. <br/><br/><br/> The advertising industry is going through massive changes to better support user privacy and we are making foundational changes to how digital ads are served in the coming years. We are looking for an outstanding candidate to join us as a full-time Principal Scientist working in a dynamic environment where your products will touch millions of customers every day and have massive impact. If you are a self-starter and enjoy applying cutting edge science to ambiguous real world problems, look no further. <br/><br/><br/> As a Principal Scientist on the Targeting team your core efforts will involve the development of Machine Learning (ML) models which match users to ads to increase relevance for customers and performance for advertisers. You will invent ML targeting and optimization approaches using a broad array of contextual and behavioural signals (when available) and your models will integrate into bidding systems which operate at low latency and a huge scale. The senior nature of this role means you will operate across multiple programs, influencing modelling frameworks and approaches and working closely with scientists, economists, engineers and business leaders to translate business and functional requirements into concrete deliverables, including design, development and testing. You will act as a thought leader and forward thinker on the team anticipating obstacles to success and helping us avoid common failure modes. You will hire and coach junior scientists and partner with engineering leaders to build efficient scalable systems.<br/> <br/>This is a unique, high visibility opportunity for a talented, motivated individual to deliver direct impact to Amazon shoppers and advertisers, to have business impact, and to dive deep into high-scale low latency problems at the cutting edge of machine learning and optimization. This role offers a compelling mix of contemporary research problems that are unique to Amazon based on the interplay between retail and advertising, scale and richness of data sets, emphasis on user experience and relevance, and complexity introduced by massive scale and concurrent experimentation across teams. In addition, you will deliver significant customer and business impact by shaping the future of the Amazon advertising experience and delivering growth to the advertising business.<br/><br/>",

On a \u201ctypical\u201d day, support engineers might deep dive to root cause a customer issue, investigate why a metric is trending the wrong way, consult with the top engineers at Amazon, or discuss radical new approaches to automate operational issues.<br/> <br/><br/> We are looking for a Support Engineer to join our energetic, fast-moving and passionate team. This is an opportunity to operate and engineer systems on a massive scale, and to gain top-notch experience in cloud computing. You'll be surrounded by people who are smart, passionate about cloud computing, and believe that world class service is critical to customer success.

Our environment is built for engineers who flourish in creating automation to reduce the operational workload rather than simply performing operational work all day.<br/> <br/><br/> Successful candidates will join an elite engineering team, provide troubleshooting and operations support, and innovate to replace operational tasks with scripts and code.

How do we get there? What does it take to solve our customers\u2019 everyday online shopping problems? Do our customers find what they are looking for? If they find what they are looking for, is it competitively priced? And if they find what they are looking for a competitive price, can it be delivered fast enough? In today\u2019s ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, how do we make sure that people across the globe can still get essential goods delivered to their homes as fast as possible? How do we reach people who are not native English speakers when there are over 7000 languages spoken in the world? How do we facilitate a seamless payment experience when there are over 180 currencies used in the world with diverse payment methods? How do we solve problems for people who have different shopping behaviours from our regular amazon.com shoppers?<br/><br/> Senior SDE @Amazon:<br/><br/>Scale at Amazon is, well, really big. There are few companies out there building at our scale and complexity, and even fewer in Europe. As a Senior Software Development Engineer (Senior SDE), you\u2019ll be part of a small group of peers that make the Amazon magic happen. Whether it\u2019s ownership of existing software or working on new products, you will lead the design and implementation of large-scale efforts from the technical perspective. You\u2019ll not only code, but also drive the direction of the software architecture, and work proactively with other teams on integration projects. Our Senior SDEs enjoy a great deal of autonomy. In addition to owning the architecture of a larger product, you will lead code reviews, mentor engineers, and drive important technical decisions.<br/><br/>Senior SDEs at Amazon are above all problem solvers, those we trust most in making technical decisions for how we build our software. They know every line of code we write matters in building great products. As the technical experts on their teams, Senior SDEs come from all different backgrounds, some deeply specialized, while others have a more generalist background. In any case, they are able to keep an eye on big picture while still keeping a finger on the pulse of the details; using both to inform their architectural and design decisions. Senior SDEs also have an eye on the bigger picture and influencing business strategy. Product managers and non-technical stakeholders will depend on you to balance technological demands with business needs.<br/><br/> Some of International Technology teams/projects:<br/> <br/> \u00b7 EMEA Expansion Team<br/><br/>When Amazon started, it had 0% of the retail industry\u2019s market share, now it accounts for 43% just for the US market. We did this by having a relentless obsession over our Customers, in fact, for the ninth consecutive year, Customers ranked Amazon #1 in Customer Satisfaction. Never a company to stand still, this team is working to bring Amazon into a new multi-billion dollar market, where we plan to deliver the same level of Customer Service as in retail. One of our challenge here is to understand how we can utilize and scale our existing architecture to serve market expansion.<br/><br/> \u00b7 INTech EU Exports team:<br/><br/>The goal is to extend our customer\u2019s shopping radius beyond the borders of their home countries. Our customers are looking for global product selection with low prices, resembling local shopping experience, with convenient returns, transparent importation process and fast shipping.<br/>As an SDE3 in our team, you will take a leading role at Amazon's Expansions, and will create end-to-end solutions that are Technically Wide, with Deep Customer Impact. You will work multiple teams, spanning through multiple diverse areas such as inventory, tax, compliance, accounting, eligibility, KYC, CX/SX/VX, transportation and fulfillment.<br/><br/> \u00b7 Amazon Consumer Localization<br/><br/>The Consumer Localization team builds the services to automatically make all of Amazon's selection available to customers world-wide, on all 10+ Amazon marketplaces, in 10+ languages. We're responsible for building fun software like machine translation models, systems for human-in-the-loop machine learning, and large-scale data processing pipelines. Using AWS, we build global-scale services that integrate with Amazon\u2019s core e-commerce technologies (eg catalog, pricing, fulfilment). The services we provide are key to powering Amazon's international expansion, localizing millions of products world-wide every day.<br/> <br/>Our team is based in Amazon\u2019s European Head Quarter in Luxembourg. However, we offer the flexibility of working remotely from Amsterdam, Berlin, London, Madrid, Barcelona, Milan, or Paris where local INTech team members are located.",
